I don't think we need to add extra unit types to make niche things more complicated and more niche, personally. If people are designing wierd units, it's up to them to add a diversity of the existing types to them. Rant over.} units. Also, if this unit is using Reason and has other \"breaker\" skills equipped, grants an additional Hit +10 and Avo +10 in combat when those skills are active.",
