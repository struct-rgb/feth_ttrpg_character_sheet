    "description": "This Unit obtains the Monster Unit type, 5 Anima Metamagic tokens and a D Rank Anima Metamagic Ability of their choice that requires a target.Additionally, this Unit gains a B Rank Anima Metamagic Ability that requires a target at B Rank (Bows) and can use Anima Metamagic abilities through any Bow. If an ability is used in this way, it uses the Bow’s Mt for any Mt and/or Mag calculation and only consumes half of the Anima Metamagic tokens required to cast the ability. If the Unit is using a Bow that deals magic-based damage, the Variant version of the Metamagic ability is used, if any. If it casts another spell, (Like Meteor Storm.) the Variant ability is ignored. If this Unit ever has 0 @{tooltip:Anima Metamagic tokens:Just going to assume this translates directly to TP now.} remaining, all Str-based weapons against this Unit will deal effective damage, this Unit’s Mag and Stamina Pool is reduced to 0 at the start of the next player phase, and they gain +15 Crit/Avo.",
