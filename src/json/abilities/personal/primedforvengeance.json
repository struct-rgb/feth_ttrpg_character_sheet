Once per enemy phase, Clara may use her reaction to make an \"attack of opportunity\" against a foe that moves out of a space that started adjacent to her that cannot be countered. An enemy hit by Clara before their first attack in enemy phase only deals half damage to Clara during that enemy phase.",
