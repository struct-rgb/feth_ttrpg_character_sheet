  "description": "If Haidar makes an attack with a throwing axe, he may also strike an enemy between him and his primary target. This damage is halved (after applying defense/res) and does not provoke a counterattack from the secondary target. Additionally, Haidar may make counterattacks with a standard 1 range axe as if it had 2 range.",
