  "description": "Every time Simdora alternates between an action that targets an enemy unit and an action that is Supportive, she Gains a Charge that when used adds a stacking +2 might to that action. If Simdora interrupts her cadence and uses two of the same type in a row, the stacks are lost and she suffers Overcharge; her actions/attacks/movement are reduced by half until the end of her next turn. If her might bonus is over 6 at the time the penalty is 100%. If over 10 she also takes flat damage equal to half her might bonus",
