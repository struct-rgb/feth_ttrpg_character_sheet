This attack deals 50% damage after applying defenses.\n\nWhen Penny or one of her battalion units defeat an foe, roll 1d4. That foe leaves the corresponding Loot, which applies its effect and is consumed if an applicable unit ends its turn in that space:\n\u00A01. Healing Salve—Ally recovers 20% HP.\n\u00A02. Rations—Ally recovers 20% SP.\n\u00A03. Barricade—Occupying ally has Avo +15 and Def +1 in combat for one turn.\n\u00A04. Snare—Foe takes 20% nonlethal damage.",
