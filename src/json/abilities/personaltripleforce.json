Once per enemy phase, this unit can spend 3 TP to use one of these reactions:\n\n • Saber Throw - Trigger: after a foe misses this unit with an attack. Make a counterattack against that foe with equipped tome regardless of range.\n • Force Push - Trigger: After foe creates a tile within 3 spaces of this unit. Use @{art::Telekinesis} targeting a player created tile, regardless of tile type.\n • Mind Trick - Trigger: Foe ends combat against this unit. Apply @{condition:Confused:[Confused]} and @{condition:Berserk:[Berserk]} to that foe for one turn; that foe moves and acts again during the next player phase and this unit is removed from the battlefield during player phase until it does.",
