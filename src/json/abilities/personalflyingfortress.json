When this Unit's HP is <= 25%, this unit can use their Save from (Magic or Weapons) on a foe within range. When Save from (Magic or Weapons) is used in this way, the foe cannot attack this Unit, and after unit can make a contested check against the foe. (Unit's STR+DEX vs. Foe's current HP * 2) If the unit wins, the foe is forcibly engaged into combat instead of this Unit if they're attacked.",
