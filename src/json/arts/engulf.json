While removed, target foe can still initiate combat with this unit as though it were at Range 1. When this unit is defeated, applied with @{condition}{Broken}{[Broken]}, before this unit initiates combat, or if it chooses to as an action, return all non-defeated foes that this unit has removed with @{art}{Engulf} to the nearest empty space to the most recent space this unit has occupied (their choice if multiple).
