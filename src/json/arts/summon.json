Apply @{condition:Sickness:[Sickness]} to that unit for one turn. All weapons a phantom is created with have the @{attribute::Bound} attribute, and any other items in a phantomâ€™s inventory go to the convoy when it is defeated. If this unit uses @{art::Summon} again while that unit is not defeated, apply the following effect instead: Do not pay TP or SP for this use of @{art::Summon}; move that allied unit to an empty space within range.",
