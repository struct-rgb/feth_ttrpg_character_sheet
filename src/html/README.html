<h2>About</h2>
<p>This webapp serves as a character creator and virtual character sheet for the collaboratively developed <a href="https://forgedbyfiresttrpg.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page">Forged by Fire Strategy TTRPG</a>. Special thanks to Bradley B. for being the impetus for this project.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>If any game data is changed, <a href="https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/definitions.js">definitions.js</a> must be regenerated by running <a href="https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/build.js">build.js</a> using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node</a> from the repository root folder. A pre-generated copy of this file for the latest version is already included in the repository. Once the file exists, the builder can then be used by opening <a href="https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/index.html">index.html</a> in a web browser, no internet connection needed.</p>
