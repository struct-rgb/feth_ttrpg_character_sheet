Forged by Fire Strategy TTRPG Character Builder
===============================================

## About

This webapp serves as a character creator and virtual character sheet for the collaboratively developed [Forged by Fire Strategy TTRPG](https://forgedbyfiresttrpg.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page). Special thanks to Bradley B. for being the impetus for this project.

## Building

If any game data is changed, [definitions.js](https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/definitions.js) must be regenerated by running [build.js](https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/build.js) using [node](https://nodejs.org/en) from the repository root folder. A pre-generated copy of this file for the latest version is already included in the repository. Once the file exists, the builder can then be used by opening [index.html](https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/index.html) in a web browser, no internet connection needed.
