# Character Creator for a Collaborative Fire Emblem: Three Houses TTRPG

## About

This webapp serves as a character creator and virtual character sheet for a collaborative homebrew TTRPG based on Fire Emblem: Three Houses, originally started by Bradley B but now run by MiasmaToast.

## Building

Currently, a javascript file for the definition data must be generated by running [this python script](https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/build.py). The builder can then be used by opening [index.html](https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/index.html) in a web browser, no internet connection needed.

#### NPC Generator

This is an experimental feature to make it faster to generate generic NPC and
enemy units. Simply pick a class, general build, a main weapon, a side weapon,
and a level, and the builder will set you up with a combat ready unit that
meets those specifications. For the sake of simplicity, setting the class also
sets these other values to recommended defaults, if you want to go even faster.

Generated units are balanced using the point buy demo for Patch #6.
